Pi is an advanced Command Line Interface (CLI) assistant built in Go. It acts as an autonomous pair-programming agent that helps developers generate, execute, and troubleshoot Python code in real-time. By leveraging the Gemini API, Pi creates a seamless feedback loop that automatically fixes runtime exceptions, manages virtual environments, and installs required packages dynamically.

---

## Key Features

- **AI Pair Programming (Gemini API Integration):** Write, design, and optimize Python code iteratively through interactive conversations.
- **Auto-Execution & Feedback Loop:** Pi writes code into temporary files (`py-cli-YYYYMMDDhhmmss.py`), runs them, and captures standard outputs, errors, and system exceptions. If the execution fails, the AI automatically analyzes the failure and attempts self-recovery.
- **Dynamic Dependency Management:** Checks the project's dependency state and automatically installs required packages using `pip` if a `requirements.txt` file is present.
- **Interactive REPL Commands:**
  - `stats`: View detailed metrics on script executions (success/failure rates).
  - `coverage`: Diagnose test automation rate and coverage details.
  - `depgraph`: Visualize imports and module dependency structures.
  - `save` / `load`: Save and load chat sessions locally (`session.json`).

---

## Technical Specifications

- **Language:** Go 1.20+
- **Primary AI Model:** Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash-lite`)
- **Default Sandboxing:** Runs inside local virtual environments (`.venv`) to ensure host safety.
- **Config Storage:** Decrypts system parameters dynamically from APPDATA (`.tea/.apikeys.json`) with AES/DPAPI fallback.

## Dependency on `tea` Repository

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Pi does not feature native API key or model configuration management.** Instead, it is designed to share settings with the [tea](https://github.com/sezzi/tea) (or equivalent parent GUI) repository.
> 
> To use Pi, you must first install and configure the **`tea`** application, which saves and encrypts the Gemini API keys and preferred target models inside the local profile path (`%APPDATA%/.tea/.apikeys.json`). Pi will automatically decrypt and load these configurations at runtime.

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Requirements
- **Go:** Version 1.20 or higher installed.
- **Python:** Version 3.8 or higher installed.
- **Dependency Setup:** The [tea](https://github.com/sezzi/tea) repository must be configured on the host system to supply decrypted credentials. Alternatively, a local environment variable fallback (`GEMINI_API_KEY`) is supported.

### 2. Configuration & Virtual Environment Setup
Pi enforces execution inside a Python Virtual Environment (`venv`) to isolate dependencies.

```bash
# 1. Create a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv

# 2. Activate the virtual environment
# Windows (PowerShell)
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
# Windows (CMD)
.\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
# Linux / macOS
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Provide your API key either via setting the environment variable or entering it on prompt:
```bash
# Set environment variable
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"  # macOS/Linux
$env:GEMINI_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key-here"   # Windows PowerShell
```

### 3. Building from Source
Build the Go executable directly in the root folder:
```bash
go build -o pi.exe
```

---

## Usage

You can run Pi with a one-off request directly from the terminal or enter interactive REPL mode by invoking the executable without parameters.

### Command Line Invocation (One-off prompt)
```bash
./pi.exe "Write a script that pulls the current weather of Seoul using public APIs"
```

### Interactive REPL Mode
```bash
./pi.exe
```
This enters the interactive shell prompt:
```text

## Deployment & Distribution

### Building Cross-Platform Executables
You can build the binary for different target platforms using Go's build variables:

**Windows:**
```bash
GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/pi-windows-amd64.exe
```
**Linux:**
```bash
GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/pi-linux-amd64
```
**macOS:**
```bash
GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o dist/pi-darwin-amd64
```

### CI/CD Deployment Flow
1. **GitHub Actions:** Create a release workflow triggered by version tags (e.g., `v*`).
2. **Matrix Build:** Compile for Windows, Linux, and macOS targets.
3. **Artifact Upload:** Package targets as zip/tar.gz and attach them to a GitHub Release.
